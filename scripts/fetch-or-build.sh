# fetch-or-build.sh — herdr [[build]] step for herdr-file-viewer.
#
# Fast path: download the prebuilt binary that matches THIS source's declared version + platform
# from the GitHub release, verify its SHA-256, and install it at target/release/herdr-file-viewer.
# The match is by VERSION, not by exact commit: a checkout that is AHEAD of the matching release
# (e.g. main has merged work that isn't tagged yet) still uses that released binary, so landing a
# PR no longer forces new users to compile while a release is pending. Integrity is unchanged — the
# binary is still SHA-256 verified — and a version with no published release still 404s to source.
# Fallback: on ANY miss (no asset for this version, network/download error, checksum mismatch,
# unmapped platform, no curl/wget) print a clear notice and build from source with cargo — identical
# to the pre-prebuilt behavior, so installing never gets harder than before.
#
# Paths and the release base URL are overridable via env (FV_REPO_ROOT / FV_CARGO_TOML / FV_OUT /
# FV_BASE_URL) so the logic is exercised by a hermetic test with stubbed uname/curl/cargo/git.
