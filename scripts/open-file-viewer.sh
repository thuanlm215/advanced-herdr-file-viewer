#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Idempotent launcher for the file viewer — used by both the `open-file-viewer` action and a
# herdr keybinding (a `[[keys.command]]` with `type = "shell"`). "Launch-or-focus, toggle on
# repeat", scoped to the current tab:
#   - no Files pane in the current tab      -> open a split (focused)
#   - a Files pane exists but isn't focused  -> focus it
#   - the focused pane IS the Files pane     -> close it ("hide"; herdr has no hide-without-close,
#                                               and reopening just re-walks the tree — cheap)
#
# herdr actions/keybindings run a command (no declarative "open this pane" field), so this shells
# out to the herdr CLI via $HERDR_BIN_PATH (herdr injects it; fall back to `herdr` on PATH).
#
# The OPEN/FOCUS/CLOSE decision is computed in-process by the viewer binary itself
# (`advanced-herdr-file-viewer --launch-decision`, fed the `pane list` JSON on stdin) — so it is unit-
# tested and the pane id it returns is already validated as flag-safe (option-injection guard).
# Any failure (binary missing, parse error, no focused pane) degrades to OPEN, preserving the
# original always-open behavior. herdr has no focus-by-id, so a focus is a `zoom <id> --on/--off`
# cycle: `--on` focuses (and maximizes) the pane, `--off` un-maximizes while keeping it focused.
