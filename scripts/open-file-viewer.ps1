# open-file-viewer.ps1 -- Windows sibling of scripts/open-file-viewer.sh.
#
# Idempotent launcher for the file viewer -- used by the `open-file-viewer-windows` action and a
# herdr keybinding. "Launch-or-focus, toggle on repeat", scoped to the current tab:
#   - no Files pane in the current tab      -> open a split (focused)
#   - a Files pane exists but isn't focused -> focus it
#   - the focused pane IS the Files pane    -> close it ("hide"; herdr has no hide-without-close,
#                                              and reopening just re-walks the tree -- cheap)
#
# WHY THIS DIVERGES FROM THE UNIX .sh (verified on real Windows, herdr 0.7.1-preview, GH #58):
# the unix launcher opens the viewer with `plugin pane open --entrypoint file-viewer`, letting herdr
# spawn the manifest's RELATIVE pane command. That does NOT work on Windows: herdr passes the
# relative program name to CreateProcessW, which resolves it against herdr's OWN directory (not any
# cwd we pass), so it fails with ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND (os error 3). herdr also stores the plugin
# root as a `\\?\` verbatim path. So on Windows we instead spawn the viewer BY ABSOLUTE PATH:
# `pane split` an empty pane, then `pane run` the absolute `.exe` into it, and `pane rename` it to
# "Files" so the toggle (below) can find it again. We root the tree at the user's focused-pane cwd
# (the viewer, launched via `pane run`, gets no HERDR_PLUGIN_CONTEXT_JSON, so it roots from its cwd).
#
# The OPEN/FOCUS/CLOSE decision is computed in-process by the viewer binary itself
# (`advanced-herdr-file-viewer.exe --launch-decision`, fed the `pane list` JSON on stdin) -- so it is
# unit-tested (src/launch.rs) and the pane id it returns is validated flag-safe. Any failure
# degrades to OPEN. herdr has no focus-by-id, so a focus is a `zoom <id> --on/--off` cycle.
