# Idempotent launcher for the file viewer in its own TAB — used by the `open-file-viewer-tab`
# action and a herdr keybinding (e.g. `prefix+shift+f`). "Open-or-switch, toggle on repeat",
# scoped across the tabs of the CURRENT WORKSPACE:
#   - no Files pane in this workspace        -> open the viewer in a new tab (focused)
#   - a Files pane in another tab of this
#     workspace                              -> switch to that tab (no duplicate viewer)
#   - a Files pane is in the current tab,
#     but not focused                        -> focus it in place
#   - the focused pane IS the Files pane      -> close it ("toggle off"; herdr auto-closes the
#                                               now-empty tab — verified)
# A viewer open in a DIFFERENT workspace is left alone and a fresh one opens here — the action
# reaches this workspace's viewer, it never switches you across workspaces.
#
# Sibling of scripts/open-file-viewer.sh (the split-pane variant). The OPEN/SWITCHTAB/FOCUS/
# CLOSE decision is computed in-process by the viewer binary (`--launch-decision-tab`, fed the
# `pane list` JSON on stdin), so it is unit-tested and the pane/tab ids it returns are validated
# flag-safe (option-injection guard). Any failure degrades to OPEN (open a fresh viewer tab).
# herdr has no focus-by-id, so an in-tab focus is a `zoom <id> --on/--off` cycle; a cross-tab
# switch is `tab focus <tab_id>`.
