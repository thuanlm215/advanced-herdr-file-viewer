//! Git Service — read-only answers to git questions (status, baseline, changed-set, diff).
//!
//! Issues **only** read-only `git` subcommands (AC-N2), capturing stdout via
//! `std::process`. Not-a-repo or any git failure degrades to an empty/neutral result so
//! the viewer keeps working as a plain browser (AC-26).
//!
//! The viewer opens *untrusted* repositories (e.g. an agent's worktree, a clone), so
//! every invocation is hardened against repo-controlled code execution: `--no-ext-diff` +
//! `--no-textconv` refuse repo-configured diff/textconv programs, `core.fsmonitor` and
//! `core.hooksPath` are neutralized, and `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0` keeps status/diff from
//! writing the index (AC-N2). Paths are parsed from NUL-delimited (`-z`) output as raw
//! bytes, so any filename — spaces, control chars, non-ASCII — maps to the real
//! filesystem path. The host's base-branch hint is threaded through every Base query so
//! the baseline used to *decide* Base matches the one used to *compute* it.
