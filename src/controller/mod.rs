//! Session Controller — orchestrate intents into coordinated state changes.
//!
//! Holds the ephemeral session state (root, git-presence, baseline, filter flags, per-file
//! view overrides, cursor/expansion via the Tree Model, focus, observed width) and turns
//! each [`Intent`] into state mutations plus a set of [`Effects`] the run loop acts on
//! (redraw, quit, force-clear). The side-effecting components — Git Service, Content
//! Renderer, Editor Launcher — are reached through injected traits so the controller is
//! unit-testable with stubs; the Tree Model is the one read-only component it drives
//! directly. No intent edits a file (AC-N3); git-only intents are inert when not in a repo
//! (AC-26); a component failure becomes a non-fatal notice, never a crash.
//!
//! **Rendering is off the input thread (AC-23).** Selecting a file *dispatches* a render
//! job to a worker thread that owns the Content Renderer; `handle()` returns immediately so
//! input never blocks on a slow external renderer. The finished text arrives later and is
//! drained by [`Controller::poll`], which the run loop calls each tick. Jobs carry a
//! monotonic sequence so a slow render for a file the user has since left is dropped rather
//! than clobbering the current selection.
//!
//! The `impl Controller` surface is split across feature submodules (each `use super::*` and adds
//! its own `pub(super)` methods to the same `Controller`): `help`, `finder`, `picker`, `infile`
//! (the bottom prompt), `mouse` (column/tree pointer handling), and `git_apply`. This module keeps
//! the type definitions, construction, the intent/poll/render core, and tree-navigation intents.
