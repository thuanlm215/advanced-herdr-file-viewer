//!
//! Functional assertions are limited to what a raw pty stream can prove *robustly*: text that
//! lands in previously-blank cells (the initial full draw, and content drawn into the empty
//! content pane on first selection of a file) appears contiguously. ratatui's differential

//! (tree_filters.rs, presenter*.rs, controller.rs); here they are driven for liveness.
//!
//! Expand is proven *functionally* and robustly: after expanding the directory and navigating
//! onto the revealed child, the child's content fills the empty pane — which can only happen
//! if expand actually revealed it. Content markers are single tokens, so the syntax renderer
//! (bat, when present) cannot split them and the assertion holds whether or not it is installed.
