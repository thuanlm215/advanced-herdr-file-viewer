//! The release workflow's contract, asserted as text (mirrors tests/manifest.rs): it triggers on
//! version tags, builds the four published targets (incl. x86_64-pc-windows-msvc, preview —
//! T-10), guards the tag against the crate version, and publishes a SHA256SUMS. These are the
//! invariants scripts/fetch-or-build.sh and fetch-or-build.ps1 rely on; GitHub Actions itself is
//! exercised by cutting a real tag (a manual verification step).
