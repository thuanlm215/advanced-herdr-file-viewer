//! The CI workflow's Windows-job contract, asserted as text (mirrors tests/release_workflow.rs):
//! a `windows-latest` test job exists and is advisory/non-blocking (`continue-on-error: true`),
//! so a Windows-only flake can never block merge of an unrelated PR (AC-19, AC-N2). GitHub
//! Actions itself is exercised by the job actually running on `windows-latest` (a manual /
//! live-CI verification step — see the spec's honest-oracle note).
